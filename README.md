# Intro to React & React Router

A beginner-friendly guide to understanding **React basics**, **hooks**, and **routing** using **React Router**. Each point includes a simple description for easy learning.

## Features Covered

### React Fundamentals

- **Functional Components** – Reusable JavaScript functions that return UI (JSX).
- **JSX** – A syntax that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
- **Props & Prop Drilling** – Passing data from parent to child components.
- **State Management (`useState`)** – Storing and updating data inside components.
- **Lifecycle (`useEffect`)** – Running code when components mount, update, or unmount.
- **Conditional Rendering** – Showing content only when certain conditions are met.
- **Lists & Keys** – Rendering arrays and giving each item a unique key.
- **Event Handling** – Handling user actions like clicks, typing, etc.
- **Forms & Controlled Components** – Handling form input with state.

### React Hooks (All Important Hooks)

- **`useState()`** – Manages component state.
- **`useEffect()`** – Runs side effects like fetching data.
- **`useContext()`** – Shares state globally without prop drilling.
- **`useRef()`** – Accesses DOM elements or stores mutable values.
- **`useMemo()`** – Caches expensive calculations for performance.
- **`useCallback()`** – Caches functions to avoid re-renders.
- **`useReducer()`** – Alternative to useState for complex state logic.
- **Custom Hooks** – Reusable logic extracted into separate functions.

### React Router Concepts

- **BrowserRouter** – Wraps the app and enables routing.
- **Routes & Route** – Defines different pages in your app.
- **Nested Routes** – Routing inside another route for layouts.
- **`Link` & `NavLink`** – For navigation without page reloads.
- **Dynamic Routing (`useParams`)** – Fetch route parameters from URL.
- **Programmatic Navigation (`useNavigate`)** – Navigate using functions.
- **Outlet** – Displays nested route content inside layouts.
- **Protected Routes** – Restrict access based on authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **React** – Component-based UI library.
- **React Router** – Library for client-side navigation.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling framework.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Modern JavaScript features and syntax.
